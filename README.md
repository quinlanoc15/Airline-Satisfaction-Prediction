# Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project

**Goal:** Machine learning project designed to predict a customers satisfaction with their airline experience. (1 = satisfied, 0 = neutral or dissatisfied)

**Data Context:** Dataset is from Kaggle. Data cleaning and engineering were done to make predictions easier. Training/Test split used was 80/20. Analysis was conducted using R.

**Models Used:**
- Single Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- BART
- Bagging
- Boosting

**Files Attached:**
- Final-Airline.Rmd
  --> Full R Markdown file consisting of code used to create the models and appropriate analysis of models, including ROC curves, AUC values, and confusion matrices.
- airline_satisfaction_slides.pdf
  --> Slide deck used to present insights from models and identify real world applications of solutions.
- airline_encoded_train.rds, airline_encoded_test.rds
  --> Files used for training and testing
